### Install Node.js

For the best experience and to avoid version conflicts with Amazon Lambda, we recommend using **v6.10.3**.

If you're using OS X or Windows, the best way to install Node.js is to use one of the installers from the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/). If you're using Linux, you can use the installer, or you can check [NodeSource's binary distributions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) to see whether or not there's a more recent version that works with your system.

To test your installation: 
Run **node -v** in your console. The version should be **6.10.3**.


### Install Git

To install Git in your console, follow [this tutorial](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

**Note:** If you’re new to Git, don’t worry. [Here’s a cheat sheet from GitHub](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) that could help you get started. However, everything that you need to know will be covered during the workshop.

To test your installation:
1. Using your conosle, navigate to the folder you want to use to download the Alexa Workshop repository.
   For example,
   ```
   cd Documents
   ```
2. Run **git clone https://github.com/wizelineacademy/AlexaWorkshop.git** in your console. You should be able to see the AlexaWorkshop files in your computer.

If you prefer using a visual application for Git, we recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
